# Roadmap

A sequencing view of the path from today's Phase-0 subset to the end state
(all of Julia, running in the browser). This is a **derived** document:
`strategy.md`'s dependency map is the source of truth for *what is unblocked*,
and this file only lays those same nodes on an effort axis to make the shape
of the whole journey legible at once.

**The axis is effort waves (`W1`–`W14`), not calendar dates.** This is
deliberate and consistent with `strategy.md`: for a mechanical port sitting
next to research-grade subtype and codegen work, invented durations would be
the exact false-precision the project's culture exists to prevent. A wave
encodes **order and relative size**, nothing more. When a gate closes and
unblocks several nodes at once, the honest move is to slide the waves — never
to convert them into a date.

## How to read this

Each increment carries a **stream** (which subsystem it deepens), a rough
**size** (`S`/`M`/`L`/`XL`, relative effort only), the **waves** it spans, and
its **dependency** into the rest of the graph. Sizes and waves are *Stated*
(in the `methodology.md` sense) — they are planning estimates, not evidence,
and the three `XL` research-grade items are the ones whose real cost is
genuinely unknowable up front.

## The increments

| Increment | Stream | Size | Waves | Depends on | Notes |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| GC exactness tail | breadth | S | W1–W2 | GC core | deferred sweep, `newpages` |
| Arrays & GenericMemory | breadth | L | W1–W3 | structs | `genericmemory.c`, `array.c` |
| Modules & bindings | breadth | M | W2–W4 | structs | `module.c`, `toplevel.c` |
| Exceptions (`enter`/`leave`) | breadth | M | W2–W3 | interpreter core | `interpreter.c`, `rtutils.c` |
| Subtype expressibility | type-depth | M | W1–W2 | subtyping core | varargs, `Type{T}`, `UnionAll` instantiation |
| Oracle expansion | type-depth | S | W1–W3 | expressibility | 53 → full `test/subtype.jl` |
| **Subtype engine** | type-depth | XL | W3–W6 | oracle | union-decision machine, `Intersect`/`Loffset`, `concrete` propagation — **research-grade** |
| Type intersection | type-depth | L | W6–W7 | subtype engine | `jl_type_intersection` |
| `type_morespecific` | type-depth | M | W7–W8 | intersection | dispatch specificity |
| Dispatch hardening | type-depth | L | W8–W9 | `morespecific`, expressibility | typemap cache, world age, ambiguity, `MethodError` |
| **Real lowering** | front-end | XL | W3–W7 | exceptions, structs, intrinsics | JuliaSyntax + JuliaLowering → `CodeInfo`; retires `frontend.rs` — **research-grade** |
| **AOT backend (Phase 1)** | compilation | XL | W9–W12 | dispatch hardening, GC exactness | build-time IR → WASM; interpreter stays as fallback — **research-grade** |
| base/ + stdlib AOT-compiled | compilation | XL | W11–W13 | modules, arrays, lowering, AOT | real Julia programs run |
| BLAS/LAPACK Phase A | performance | S | W13 | base/ | generic fallbacks — free with base/ |
| BLAS Phase B — Rust kernels | performance | L | W13–W14+ | Phase A | `gemm`/`getrf`/… behind the LBT surface |
| WebGPU offload (Phase C) | performance | L | W14+ | Phase B | large matrices behind the same interface |
| Tasks & threading | platform | L | W13–W14+ | base/ | WASM stack-switching, SharedArrayBuffer — platform-gated |

## Milestones

| # | Wave | Milestone | What it means |
| - | - | - | - |
| M1 | end W3 | Breadth online | Arrays, modules, exceptions land; the oracle grows with expressibility. Programs stay interpreted, but the vocabulary is finally Julia-shaped. |
| M2 | end W7 | Faithful front-end | `frontend.rs` retired; JuliaSyntax + JuliaLowering produce real `CodeInfo`. Source compatibility stops being a bootstrap subset. |
| M3 | end W9 | Type & dispatch faithful | Subtype engine healed against the grown oracle; intersection and `type_morespecific` in place; dispatch hardened (cache, world age, ambiguity, `MethodError`). |
| M4 | end W12 | AOT MVP | The build-time IR → WASM backend compiles the hot path; the interpreter remains the open-world fallback. |
| **M5** | **end W13** | **Real Julia in the browser** | **The end-state threshold.** `base/` and `stdlib` AOT-compiled and running through the `rj_` ABI. LinearAlgebra's generic fallbacks (BLAS Phase A) come free — linear algebra becomes a performance problem, not a correctness one. |
| M6 | W14+ | Fast & concurrent | BLAS Phase B (Rust kernels) and Phase C (WebGPU); tasks & threading as the WASM platform matures. Ongoing, platform-gated. |

## The critical path

```
subtype expressibility → subtype engine → type intersection →
type_morespecific → dispatch hardening → AOT backend → base/ + stdlib AOT
```

Breadth (arrays, modules, exceptions) and real lowering run in parallel with
this spine, but they are **joins into it, not detours off it**: `base/` cannot
be compiled until all of them hold. A parallel stream that gates the final
milestone is on the critical path in every way that matters — it just isn't
the longest single chain.

## Where the schedule lives or dies

Three increments carry nearly all the uncertainty. Every wave estimate past
`W9` is downstream of them, so a slip here slides everything after it.

- **Subtype engine.** The global union-decision machine that heals the
  oracle's one known divergence — the behavior of ~6.3k lines of C
  (`subtype.c`), including the `Intersect`/`Loffset` machinery the current
  port predates.
- **Real lowering.** Putting JuliaSyntax/JuliaLowering in place of the
  bootstrap parser is a large integration carrying its own semantics, not a
  drop-in.
- **AOT backend.** Replacing Julia's LLVM JIT with a build-time IR → WASM
  compiler is the single biggest unbuilt bet in the plan. The `XL` on that row
  and the next is doing an enormous amount of hidden work: AOT-compiling
  Julia's dynamic, open-world semantics is an unsolved problem upstream too,
  not merely a large one. This is the row to interrogate before trusting any
  wave to the right of it.

## AOT-readiness carry-forward

The interpreter and the eventual AOT'd code are two front-ends over **one**
heap, one IR, and one dispatch service (`strategy.md`). Most of what makes an
increment "AOT-ready" costs almost nothing while that increment is being built
the first time, and becomes a rewrite once the backend depends on it. The rows
below are those constraints, each **bound to the increment that owns it** —
recorded here so the constraint travels with the work when it is picked from
the frontier. Per `methodology.md`, a row graduates into an `implementation.md`
obligation at build time; the point is that **no separate "make X AOT-ready"
item is ever created — the retrofit item is avoided, not scheduled.**

The litmus behind every row: *could a compiled function, running as raw WASM
with no interpreter present, do this by touching only linear memory and
defined runtime entry points?* If meaning lives in a host-side Rust structure
instead, the compiler has nothing to emit.

| Carry-forward constraint | Owning increment | Cost now | Risk if deferred |
| - | - | - | - |
| `GenericMemory` backed by a linear-memory buffer in Julia's layout — **not** a host `Vec` — so `arrayref`/`arrayset` lower to a bounds check + `load`/`store` | Arrays & GenericMemory | ~none (it is how you build it once you know) | **high** — array access is the hottest path; a host-`Vec` backing kills the perf thesis at the array boundary and forces a full rewrite |
| `enter`/`leave` modeled as an explicit handler stack **in linear memory** (not a Rust `Result`/`panic`) so compiled and interpreted code unwind through one mechanism | Exceptions | low | **high** — a compiled function cannot return a Rust `Result`; the wrong mechanism means rewriting unwinding |
| Interpreter consumes the **same** `CodeInfo` shape the backend will (retiring `frontend.rs`'s ad-hoc IR) | Real lowering | already the plan | medium — otherwise two IRs and a permanent translation layer |
| Method resolution is a pure, reusable `(f, argtypes) → method` query, plus a defined stable **world** to compile against, so the backend can devirtualize at build time and share the runtime fallback | Dispatch hardening | low–med | medium — no build-time devirtualization means most AOT speed is left on the table |
| A defined **calling convention** for a method — gcframe threading, which args arrive boxed vs. unboxed, how the result returns — shared by interpreter and compiled methods | Dispatch hardening / AOT backend | low | medium — marshalling at every interpreter↔compiled fallback boundary otherwise |
| The gcframe / shadow-stack layout **frozen as a documented ABI contract** (compiled code must emit it byte-for-byte) | freeze now, while the surface is tiny | ~none | medium — changing it after the backend emits it churns codegen |
| Region base kept cheaply reachable by compiled code (a known global), so `base + offset` is a two-instruction address | `rj_` ABI | ~none | low–med — otherwise a call per dereference |
| Intrinsics stay pure and value-typed; nothing relies on **heap identity** for primitives (egal-by-bits already holds) so the backend is free to unbox into `i64`/`f64` locals | standing invariant | none (already true) | low — cheap to violate by accident, and a violation blocks unboxing wholesale |
| Layout features the backend will need before it can compile those field cases: inline isbits unions (selector bytes), inline immutables containing pointers (`hasptr`/`first_ptr`), atomics | Structs layout tail | med | medium — the backend cannot compile those field accesses until the layout supports them |

**How this reduces the backlog.** Every row above is an item that *does not
get added* if the owning increment honors it the first time. The cheapest way
to shrink the total is therefore not to find new quick wins but to refuse to
manufacture retrofit work — build each pre-AOT increment AOT-consciously, and
the AOT stage inherits a runtime it can compile against instead of one it must
first repair.
